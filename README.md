# Credit Risk Analysis with Supervised Machine Learning

## Overview of Project
A loan company, Fast Lending, would like to gauge credit risk by using Supervised Machine Learning (SML). Management believes that SML will lead to higher accuracy, a lower percentage of loan defaults, quicker turnaround time, and a stable experience. You have been assigned to work on SML with the lead data scientist. In this role you will be writing algorithms and creating modules regarding credit risk. You will also be running these algorithms to evaluate their accuracy at predicting data.
